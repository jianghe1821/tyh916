        <h2>Major</h2>
        <p>I am majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.
             I have a strong background in programming and data structures. 
             I have also completed several courses in data structures and algorithms,
              which have helped me to improve my problem-solving skills.
               I am also experienced in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
               I have also completed several courses in web development, 
               including front-end development using React and Angular, 
               and back-end development using Node.js and Python. 
               I am also experienced in database management using SQL and NoSQL databases,
                and have completed several courses in database management. 
                I am also experienced in cloud computing using Amazon Web Services (AWS),
                 and have completed several courses in cloud computing. Overall,
                 I am a versatile and resourceful major,
                  with a strong foundation in computer science and data structures, 
                  a strong understanding of web development, 
                  database management, and cloud computing.(faked)</p>

        <h2>True version:</h2>
        <p>I'm indeed a student who majored in Computer Science,
             or I wouldn't be here typing those commands so that I could finish my assignment on time.
              I'd rather sleep! Though saying that, I find coding both annoying and interesting, 
              and I think I made the right decision for picking such a major.</p>
        <p>
            To be honest, I don't have any idea about which major I should choose until junior 3,
            when I was during my most busy time. I liked computer games, and I wanted to play it,
            but... damn, I didn't have any time. That's when I decide I should make my own game and play.
            If I could earn my living though that, who else could stop me?
            And it was such childish thought that lead me to this path.
            But I don't regret it. Not now, not ever.
